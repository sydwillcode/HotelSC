# Hotel SC 
This project was created using HTML5 and CSS. I chose to create this project without frameworks or libraries to solidify my knowledge of pure CSS... you never know when you'll need to refactor old code, or when plain CSS will do the trick. Take a look at the CSS to see how utility classes are being used to build more reusable code!
